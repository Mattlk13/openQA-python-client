# Utility function to read the README file.
# Used for the long_description.  It's nice, because now 1) we have a top level
# README file and 2) it's easier to type in the README file than to put a raw
# string in below. Stolen from
# https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html
